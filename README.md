# Writing Tool

This is a project I did during my sophomore year at Brown in the Humans To Robots Laboratory. The goal was to develop an adapatable writing tool for the Baxter robot to be able to grip and ungrip on it's own. Furthermore, I developed an associated python script to allow anyone to make Baxter use the writing tool to write letters from english alphabet and apply affine transformatons. 

AI_HRI.pdf is a workshop paper I sent to AI HRI that was not accepted, so I thought it might as well go here!
